## Welcome to the Barrowmaze

#### A classic fantasy megadungon

Local villagers whisper of a mysterious
place deep in the marsh -- a place
shrouded in mist and dotted with
barrow mounds, ruined columns, and
standing stones. The tomb-robbers
who explore beneath the mounds, or
rather the few who return, tell tales of
labyrinthine passages, magnificent grave
goods, and terrifying creatures waiting
in the dark. Are you brave (or foolish)
enough to enter Barrowmaze?
