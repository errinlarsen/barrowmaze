## A classic fantasy megadungon

Local villagers whisper of a mysterious place deep in the marsh -- a place
shrouded in mist and dotted with barrow mounds, ruined columns, and standing
stones. The tomb-robbers who explore beneath the mounds, or rather the few who
return, tell tales of labyrinthine passages, magnificent grave goods, and
terrifying creatures waiting in the dark.

#### Are you brave (or foolish) enough to enter Barrowmaze?
